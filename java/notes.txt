mysql queries needed:

- join tables so main searches return genre names and group names and type name.

- if updating, filter genre, group and type to update relevant tables first before updating main.

- search query for multiple paramaters.


for multiple queries:
"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb?allowMultiQueries=true"

String query = "SELECT Id, Name FROM Authors WHERE Id=1;"
             + "SELECT Id, Name FROM Authors WHERE Id=2;"
             + "SELECT Id, Name FROM Authors WHERE Id=3";

this query works for view



SELECT `m`.`id` AS `ID`,
       `m`.`title` AS `Title`, 
       `m`.`path` AS `Path`, 
       `ge`.`genre` AS `Genre`,
       `gr`.`group` AS `Group`,
       `t`.`genre` AS `Type`
FROM `main` AS `m`
LEFT JOIN `genres` AS `ge`
ON `m`.`genre` = `ge`.`id`
LEFT JOIN `groups` AS `gr`
ON `m`.`group` = `gr`.`id`
LEFT JOIN `type` AS `t`
ON `m`.`type` = `t`.`id`
WHERE `m`.`type` = 1;
